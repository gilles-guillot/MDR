# MDR
Test Loewe additivity with Model Deviation Ratio
It provides tools for computing the model deviation ratio (MDR) statistic and assessing the significance 
of the observed departure from Loewe additivity. 

It also provides tools for the analysis of single compound dose-response experiment data. 
It is a companion package to the article Macacu, A., S. Lasagni, E. Carnesecchi, J.L Dorne, and G. Guillot. 2019. “Dose-Response Analysis of Toxicological and Pharmacological Mixtures with the Model Deviation Ratio Method: Problems and
Solutions.”
